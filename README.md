## Why is my text doubled when I save?

If you're using **Grammarly**, then you may experience doubled-up text in Gingko Writer. I'd like to find a fix, but in the meantime, you can disable Grammarly on gingkowriter.com by following these instructions:

## How do I invite collaborators to my documents?

Gingko Writer doesn't support collaboration yet. If this is a needed feature, you can still use the legacy https://gingkoapp.com version for collaboration and tree-sharing.

I am looking forward to adding collaboration to Gingko Writer, but I don't have an estimate on how long it'll take me. I won't disable the old version until well after collaboration is added to the new one though.

## How do I make my own custom templates?

If you want to create your own starting point for a type of document, the simplest way is to:

1. Export your template/starting document as JSON.

2. Import it whenever you want to use it as a template.

## When will the old/legacy version be shut down?

There is no firm date for the shutdown of gingkoapp.com, but rest assured that there will be _many_ reminders and opportunities to move your data to the new version.
